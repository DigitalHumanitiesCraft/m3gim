# Research Context: M³GIM

## Project Identity

**Title:** Mapping Mobile Musicians - Mobilität und Musiktheaterwissen im Graz der Nachkriegszeit am Beispiel der Sängerin Ira Malaniuk
**Acronym:** M³GIM
**Duration:** 01.01.2026 – 31.12.2026 (Feasibility study for FWF follow-up project)
**Lead:** Univ.-Prof.in Dr.in Nicole K. Strohmann (KUG Graz)
**Technical Implementation:** Dr. Christopher Pollin (Digital Humanities Craft OG)

## Research Object

Ira Malaniuk (1919-2009), Ukrainian-Austrian mezzo-soprano, spent her first two decades in Ukraine, professionalized despite multiple forced migrations in Vienna, and received her first permanent engagement as an altist at the Graz Opera House (1945-1947). From there, she launched an international career working with Wieland Wagner (Bayreuth Festival), Rudolf Hartmann, and conductors including Knappertsbusch, Furtwängler, and Karajan. In 1970, she became professor for Lied interpretation at KUG Graz. Her biography embodies the narrative of "Graz as a springboard for international stage careers."

The project investigates transnational knowledge transfer in postwar music theater (1945-1969) with geographic focus on the Graz Opera as a cultural interface. Mobility is understood not only geographically, but encompasses mental, cultural, intellectual, compositional, and vocal forms of movement.

## Research Questions

**RQ1 - Urban Culture:** How did singers shape Graz's music and theater culture? What role did mobility play in professionalization and networking?

**RQ2 - Genre Transformation:** Which narrative and aesthetic structures were influenced by migration, and how did these contribute to the transformation of opera after WWII?

**RQ3 - Knowledge Transfer:** How was music theater knowledge—ephemeral, often orally transmitted knowledge—transferred through mobility and adapted in new contexts?

**RQ4 - Mobility Forms:** Which specific forms of mobility (national, geographic, forced migration, educational, lifestyle mobility) can be identified in Malaniuk's case, and how did these influence her career and knowledge production?

## Central Hypothesis

Mobility of singers was not only a prerequisite for careers, but a catalyst for new knowledge cultures and aesthetic paradigms in music theater. By digitally mapping biographical mobility patterns, professional networks, and repertoire development, we can reveal hidden structures of knowledge circulation that shaped postwar European opera culture.

## Methodology

The project combines musicological, gender-sensitive, and cultural analysis with digital methods of data modeling, network analysis, and visualization. The innovative approach proceeds from an **actor-centered perspective** rather than traditional genre history, elevating digital mobility research to an epistemological category. The Ira Malaniuk estate (182 archival units, 17 boxes, UAKUG/NIM) provides a rich source base including autobiographical texts, activity lists (1924-1968), programs (1954-1977), comprehensive repertoire register (1940-1969), contracts (1952-1968), press materials, correspondence, and photographs.

## Digital Research Infrastructure

The project develops a three-tier digital infrastructure: (1) structured data capture in Google Sheets with controlled vocabularies, (2) automated export to JSON-LD based on Records in Contexts (RiC) standard with domain-specific extensions, and (3) web-based presentation via GitHub Pages with search, filter, visualization, and export functions. This low-barrier approach enables sustainable data maintenance without programming knowledge while ensuring long-term archival compatibility and future migration to systems like GAMS or international mobility databases.

## Expected Outcomes

**Phase 1 (2026-2027):** Structured catalog of 182 archival units, web-based prototype with search/filter functions, initial visualizations of mobility and networks, Open Access publication. **Phase 2 (FWF proposal):** Extended network analysis and cultural mapping, comprehensive study of singers at European cultural centers in 19th/20th centuries, international research data networking.

## Research Gaps Addressed

- **Graz Opera History:** No scholarly literature on NS-era, no systematic examination of opera singer mobility
- **Malaniuk Biography:** No academic literature exists on this significant artist
- **Digital Mobility Research:** Methodological contribution to ephemeral knowledge transfer in performing arts
- **Gender Perspective:** Female agency in postwar European cultural reconstruction
